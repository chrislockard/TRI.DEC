## Division

A Division is intended to represent the sum of activities or endeavors in your life. Think of Divisions as sections
in a bookstore.

__Example__: I assign a Division code of `103` to anything related to my pursuit of knowledge. 

## Group

A Group is intended to represent a collection of items related to a Division. Think of Groups as books on the shelves
in a section (Division) of a bookstore.

__Example__: I assign a Division code of `103` to anything related to my pursuit of knowledge, and a Group code of 
`101` to ideas I have that warrant more examination.

## Identifier (ID)

Finally, an Identifier (ID) is intended to represent the smallest atomic collection of items related to a Group. Think of
IDs as the chapters inside of a book (Group) on the shelf in a section (Division) in a bookstore.

__Example__: I assign a Division code of `103` to anything related to my pursuit of knowledge, and a Group code of 
`101` to ideas I have that warrant more examination, and an ID of `112` to gift ideas.
